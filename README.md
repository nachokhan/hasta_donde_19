# ¿POR DONDE PUEDO ANDAR?

This project is based on the goberment's rule that because of the Covid19 pandemic a persone can not go further than 5km from his house (for running & biking).
The idea is to have a tracking app that shows you which is your "allowed movement circle" showing the distance to your house.
If for any reason you go beyond the circle, it will warn you about it.

But for privacy issues, this app is NOT going to send any info to the internet. Every tracking position is only showed in the screen and then deleted.
So it is just an app for the person who uses it. No one else can see it.
